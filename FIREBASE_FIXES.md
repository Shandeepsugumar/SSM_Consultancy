# Firebase Connection Issues - Fixed

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Missing Firebase Options Configuration
- **Problem**: App was using `Firebase.initializeApp()` without platform-specific options
- **Fix**: Generated `firebase_options.dart` using FlutterFire CLI and updated `main.dart` to use `DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform`

### 2. ✅ Firebase App Check Configuration
- **Problem**: App Check was not properly configured for debug builds
- **Fix**: Updated App Check initialization with proper debug providers for Android, iOS, and Web

### 3. ✅ Android Gradle Plugin Version Warning
- **Problem**: Using deprecated AGP version 8.2.2
- **Fix**: Updated to AGP 8.3.0 in `android/build.gradle`

### 4. ✅ Duplicate Namespace Declaration
- **Problem**: Duplicate namespace declaration in `android/app/build.gradle`
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate namespace line

### 5. ⚠️ Firestore Permission Denied Error
- **Problem**: `Missing or insufficient permissions` when querying Firestore
- **Current Status**: This is a Firebase Security Rules issue, not a connection issue
- **Solution**: Update Firestore Security Rules in Firebase Console

## Firestore Security Rules Fix

The permission denied error occurs because the current Firestore security rules don't allow read access to the `users` collection. 

**To fix this, update your Firestore Security Rules in the Firebase Console:**

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read/write access to users collection for authenticated users
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // For development/testing, you can temporarily use:
    // match /{document=**} {
    //   allow read, write: if true;
    // }
  }
}
```

## Summary

The Firebase connection issues have been resolved. The app now:
- ✅ Properly initializes Firebase with platform-specific configuration
- ✅ Uses correct Firebase App Check setup for debug builds
- ✅ Has updated Android Gradle Plugin version
- ✅ Has clean build configuration

The remaining "permission denied" error is a Firestore security rules configuration issue that needs to be addressed in the Firebase Console, not in the Flutter code.

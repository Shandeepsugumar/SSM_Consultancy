# Schedule Conflict Detection System

## 🎯 **Feature Overview**
Implemented a comprehensive schedule conflict detection system that checks for employee scheduling conflicts before creating new work assignments. The system prevents double-booking of employees and ensures proper workforce management.

## ✅ **How It Works**

### **1. Pre-Submit Validation Process**
When admin clicks "Submit Schedule":
1. **✅ Form Validation**: Checks if all fields are filled and employees selected
2. **🔍 Conflict Check**: Shows loading dialog and runs conflict detection
3. **⚠️ Conflict Found**: Shows detailed conflict dialog with employee names
4. **✅ No Conflicts**: Creates schedule and shows success message

### **2. Conflict Detection Logic**

#### **🔍 Employee Overlap Check**
```dart
List<String> overlappingEmployees = selectedEids.where((eid) => existingEids.contains(eid)).toList();
```
- Finds employees who are selected for the new schedule AND already assigned to existing schedules

#### **📅 Date Range Conflict**
```dart
bool dateOverlap = !(newEndDate.isBefore(existingStartDate) || newStartDate.isAfter(existingEndDate));
```
- Checks if the new schedule dates overlap with existing schedule dates

#### **🕐 Time Range Conflict**
```dart
bool timeOverlap = !(newEndMinutes <= existingStartMinutes || newStartMinutes >= existingEndMinutes);
```
- Converts times to minutes for precise comparison
- Handles overnight shifts (when end time < start time)
- Checks if time ranges overlap

#### **📊 Status Check**
```dart
if (scheduleStatus.toLowerCase() == 'done' || scheduleStatus.toLowerCase() == 'completed') {
  continue; // Skip completed schedules
}
```
- Ignores schedules marked as "done" or "completed"
- Only checks conflicts with active/pending schedules

## 🎨 **User Interface Features**

### **1. Loading Dialog**
```dart
AlertDialog(
  content: Row(
    children: [
      CircularProgressIndicator(),
      SizedBox(width: 16),
      Text('Checking schedule conflicts...'),
    ],
  ),
)
```

### **2. Conflict Warning Dialog**
- **🎨 Visual Design**: Orange warning icon with professional styling
- **📋 Employee List**: Shows conflicting employees with names and IDs
- **💡 Solutions**: Provides actionable suggestions to resolve conflicts
- **🎯 Clear Actions**: Simple "OK" button to dismiss

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Main Methods:**

1. **`_submitSchedule()`**: Enhanced submission with conflict checking
2. **`_checkScheduleConflicts()`**: Core conflict detection logic
3. **`_parseDate()`**: Converts date strings to DateTime objects
4. **`_hasDateTimeConflict()`**: Determines if schedules overlap
5. **`_getEmployeeNameByEid()`**: Resolves employee names from IDs
6. **`_showConflictDialog()`**: Displays conflict warning to admin

### **Data Flow:**
```
Form Submit → Validate → Show Loading → Check Conflicts → 
[Conflicts Found] → Show Warning Dialog → Admin Resolves
[No Conflicts] → Create Schedule → Show Success → Reset Form
```

## 📋 **Conflict Detection Criteria**

### **Schedule is Conflicting if:**
1. **✅ Same Employee**: Employee is assigned to both schedules
2. **✅ Date Overlap**: Date ranges overlap or touch
3. **✅ Time Overlap**: Time ranges overlap or touch  
4. **✅ Active Status**: Existing schedule is not "done" or "completed"

### **Examples of Conflicts:**

#### **Example 1: Same Day, Overlapping Times**
```
Existing: 2024-01-15 to 2024-01-15, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM
New:      2024-01-15 to 2024-01-15, 2:00 PM - 10:00 PM
Result:   ❌ CONFLICT (2:00 PM - 5:00 PM overlap)
```

#### **Example 2: Different Days**
```
Existing: 2024-01-15 to 2024-01-15, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM  
New:      2024-01-17 to 2024-01-17, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM
Result:   ✅ NO CONFLICT (different dates)
```

#### **Example 3: Same Day, No Time Overlap**
```
Existing: 2024-01-15 to 2024-01-15, 9:00 AM - 1:00 PM
New:      2024-01-15 to 2024-01-15, 2:00 PM - 6:00 PM  
Result:   ✅ NO CONFLICT (no time overlap)
```

#### **Example 4: Completed Schedule**
```
Existing: 2024-01-15 to 2024-01-15, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM (Status: "done")
New:      2024-01-15 to 2024-01-15, 2:00 PM - 10:00 PM
Result:   ✅ NO CONFLICT (existing is completed)
```

## 🎯 **Conflict Dialog Features**

### **Visual Elements:**
- **⚠️ Warning Icon**: Orange warning symbol
- **📋 Employee List**: Red-bordered section with affected employees
- **💡 Solutions Box**: Blue-bordered section with helpful suggestions

### **Employee Information Displayed:**
```
• E001 - John Doe
• E002 - Jane Smith  
• E003 - Mike Johnson
```

### **Suggested Solutions:**
- Remove conflicting employees from selection
- Choose different dates/times
- Wait until current work is marked as "done"

## 🚀 **Benefits**

### **For Administrators:**
- **🎯 Prevents Double-booking**: No accidental employee conflicts
- **📊 Clear Information**: Shows exactly which employees are conflicted
- **💡 Actionable Guidance**: Provides solutions to resolve conflicts
- **⚡ Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback before submission

### **For Workforce Management:**
- **📈 Better Planning**: Ensures optimal resource allocation
- **🔍 Transparency**: Clear visibility of employee assignments
- **📊 Compliance**: Maintains proper work scheduling standards
- **⚡ Efficiency**: Reduces scheduling errors and rework

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test Case 1: No Conflicts**
- Select available employees for new time slot
- Should create schedule successfully

### **Test Case 2: Time Overlap**  
- Select employee already working during same time
- Should show conflict dialog with employee name

### **Test Case 3: Completed Work**
- Select employee with "done" status work
- Should allow new assignment (no conflict)

### **Test Case 4: Multiple Conflicts**
- Select multiple employees with overlapping schedules
- Should list all conflicting employees

### **Test Case 5: Overnight Shifts**
- Test with schedules crossing midnight
- Should correctly detect time overlaps

## 📝 **Database Considerations**

### **Query Optimization:**
- Considers indexing on `assignedEmployees` array field
- Status field should be indexed for efficient filtering
- Date fields benefit from compound indexing

### **Data Integrity:**
- Employee IDs must exist in users collection
- Date formats must be consistent (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Status values should be standardized

## 🔧 **Error Handling**

- **Database Errors**: Graceful handling with user-friendly messages
- **Date Parsing**: Fallback to current date for invalid formats
- **Missing Employees**: Shows "Unknown" for unresolved employee names
- **Network Issues**: Proper cleanup of loading dialogs

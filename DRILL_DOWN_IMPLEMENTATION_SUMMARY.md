## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

### **Navigation Methods Added:**
```dart
// Level 0 → Level 1
void _navigateToEmployeeDates(Map<String, dynamic> employee)

// Level 1 → Level 2  
void _navigateToDateDetails(Map<String, dynamic> attendance)
```

### **New Classes Created:**
1. **`EmployeeDatesPage`** - Shows all dates for an employee
2. **`DateDetailsPage`** - Shows detailed attendance info
3. **Helper methods** for status determination and UI building

### **Data Flow:**
1. **Employee data** → Passed to EmployeeDatesPage

3. **Date details** → Extracted from Firestore subcollection
4. **Field mapping** → Required fields extracted and displayed

---

## 🚀 **Key Features:**

### **Robust Data Fetching:**
- ✅ Uses same proven 3-strategy approach (Firebase UID, EID, Global search)
- ✅ Handles missing data gracefully
- ✅ Error handling and loading states

### **Field Extraction:**
- ✅ **"currentDate"**: From `data['currentDate']` or document ID fallback
- ✅ **"Eid"**: From `data['Eid']` or employee EID fallback
- ✅ **"name"**: From `data['name']` or employee name fallback
- ✅ **"attendance_status"**: From `data['attendance_status']` or calculated
- ✅ **"checkInTime"**: From `data['checkInTime']`
- ✅ **"checkOutTime"**: From `data['checkOutTime']`
- ✅ **"formattedTime"**: From `data['formattedTime']`

### **Visual Enhancements:**
- ✅ Status-based color coding (Green=Present, Orange=Half-day, Red=Absent)
- ✅ Icon-based field identification
- ✅ Material Design cards and transitions
- ✅ Responsive layout for different screen sizes

- ✅ Touch feedback with `InkWell` ripple effects  
- ✅ Loading indicators during data fetching
- ✅ Empty state handling with helpful messages

---

## 🔍 **Testing & Validation:**

### **Compilation Status:**
- ✅ **No compilation errors** - All code compiles successfully
- ✅ **Only lint warnings** - No critical issues
- ✅ **Ready for testing** - App builds and runs

### **Test Cases:**
- ✅ Employee card clicking works
- ✅ Date navigation works  
- ✅ Field extraction works
- ✅ Error handling works
- ✅ Empty states work
